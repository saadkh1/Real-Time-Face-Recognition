# Real-Time Face Recognition Project

This project is based on real-time facial recognition using popular libraries such as face-recognition and OpenCV. The aim of this project is to create a robust and accurate system for facial recognition that can be used in real-time applications such as security systems, attendance tracking, and user authentication. This project also uses the phone camera for facial recognition, which makes it a practical solution for mobile applications.

The project is implemented in Python and can be easily run on any machine with the required libraries installed. IP Webcam is used to capture real-time video, which is then processed by the facial recognition system.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

To run the app, you can run:

``python main.py``

This project provides a powerful and flexible tool for real-time facial recognition that can be used in a wide range of applications, including mobile applications that utilize IP Webcam for real-time video capture.
